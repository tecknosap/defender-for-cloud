# Terraform-Infrastructure-Setup-for-Azure-Defender

Welcome to **Terraform-Infrastructure-Setup-for-Azure-Defender**! This repository demonstrates how to use **Terraform** to automate the management of **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** pricing tiers across various Azure services. It showcases how Infrastructure as Code (IaC) can be leveraged to manage security configurations, integrate with **Azure DevOps** pipelines, and ensure cost-efficient and scalable security coverage in Azure.

## Objectives

This project aims to:

- Automate management of **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** pricing tiers for multiple Azure services.
- Enable/disable Defender security coverage dynamically using Terraform.
- Integrate security configurations into **CI/CD pipelines** for continuous infrastructure management.
- Implement reusable and modular **Terraform configurations** for efficient security management.

## What I Learned

Key takeaways include:

- **Terraform Fundamentals**: 
  - Using variables, maps, and conditional statements for dynamic configurations.
  - Writing **modular and reusable** Terraform code.
- **Azure Security Services**:
  - Gained experience with **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** and its integration with Azure services.
  - Managed **Defender** pricing tiers for Azure resources like Virtual Machines, SQL Databases, Storage Accounts, and Key Vaults.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Scalable and maintainable Terraform code structure.
  - Managing security through Defender for Azure services.
- **Practical Tools**:
  - Proficiency with **Azure CLI** for resource interaction.
  - Effective troubleshooting and debugging of Terraform deployments.
  - Integrated **Terraform** with **Azure DevOps** pipelines for automated security management.

## End Result

The project automates the configuration of **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** pricing tiers for the following Azure services:

- **Virtual Machines**: Defender Standard tier enabled for enhanced security.
- **App Services**: Security features enabled for web app hosting.
- **Storage Accounts**: Configured for secure cloud storage.
- **Key Vaults**: Integrated Defender security for key and certificate management.
- **Containers**: Security enabled for containerized workloads.
- **SQL Servers**: Defender coverage for secured relational databases.
- **Resource Manager & Cosmos DBs**: Configured security monitoring.

The solution dynamically enables or disables Defender services based on configurable variables and integrates seamlessly with **Azure DevOps pipelines** for continuous deployment.

## Repository Highlights

This repository serves as a guide for:

- Beginners looking to learn **Terraform** and **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.
- Cloud professionals automating the management of **Azure security services** using Terraform.
- DevOps engineers integrating **security automation** into **CI/CD pipelines**.
- Those seeking reusable **Terraform templates** for managing **Defender for Cloud** across Azure services.

## Next Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Terraform-Infrastructure-Setup-for-Azure-Defender.git
Review and modify the defender_for_cloud_endpoints variable to enable or disable specific Defender services.

Follow the Terraform Getting Started guide for detailed instructions.

Customize the configurations for your Azure environment and security requirements.

Integrate the configuration into Azure DevOps for automated infrastructure management and security updates.
